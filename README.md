This is a role playing game made with jquery and styled with bootstrap.
(note- this is my first draft of the game. I want to try making it again w new architecture: 
-listeners on each character
-objects for each character
-cleaner functions for choosing a new challenger, winning and losing)

ABOUT THE GAME:
There are 4 characters. You choose one and the other 3 become your enemies. You have to battle them one-by-one to defeat them all and win the game. 
As you battle, your attacks get stronger. You cannot win battling in any order-- you need to battle the weaker opponents first in order to level up and beat the stronger ones. The characters are from My Little Pony, so use your MLP knowledge to guide you through. 
*spoiler- One character cannot lose. The imbalance isn't an error. Life is full of OPs. She's just one of them.
